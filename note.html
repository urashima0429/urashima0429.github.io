<p>
    I hold a Master's degree in Informatics from Kyoto University and am currently pursuing a PhD in Information Physics and Computing at the University of Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
    Over the past five years, I have focused on using domain-specific computer architectures to achieve: (1) Low-latency object detection in autonomous mobile robots (AMR), (2) Low-latency feature extraction for SLAM on Smart Network Interface Cards, (3) Performance modeling of data flow computations across multiple FPGAs, and (4) Accelerating structure learning of Bayesian networks using FPGAs.
    During this time, I have published over 5 peer-reviewed papers/proceedings and secured competitive research funding, including JSPS DC2.

<p>
    Currently, I am working on scalable neural network training by integrating knowledge of both algorithms and architectures to address the memory-intensive nature of backpropagation.

    I am open to offers for various positions. Ideally, I am looking for a role where I can make an impact on the physical world by applying my experience in further accelerating and optimizing the latest technologies in deep learning and computer vision using FPGAs and ASICs.
